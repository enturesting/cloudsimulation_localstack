# üõ†Ô∏è Terraform + LocalStack Script Utilities

This folder contains helpful PowerShell scripts to manage and visualize Terraform environments powered by LocalStack.
---

## üìÅ Script Descriptions

### `apply_env.ps1`
Deploys a Terraform environment by specifying the environment name (`dev` or `nonprod`).
#### **Usage**
.\apply_env.ps1 -env dev
.\apply_env.ps1 -env nonprod

### `clean-reset.ps1`
Performs a hard reset of all local state:
Deletes Terraform state files. Wipes LocalStack data directory. Useful for full environment reboots
#### **Usage**
.\clean-reset.ps1

### `register_mock_ami.ps1`
Registers a mock AMI in LocalStack for use with EC2 testing.
This bypasses the lack of public AMI support in LocalStack by simulating an AMI registration.
‚úÖ Make sure LocalStack is running and the AWS CLI is properly configured.
#### **Usage**
.\register_mock_ami.ps1

### `reset_localstack.ps1`
Stops and restarts the LocalStack container (e.g., if you're running it manually or via Rancher Desktop), and clears residual data.
#### **Usage**
.\reset_localstack.ps1

### `visualize_aws_tf_env.ps1`
Displays current LocalStack resources (S3, DynamoDB, IAM, EC2) for the specified environment (dev, nonprod, or all).
Useful for debugging and verifying what exists in your simulated AWS environment. Supports: dev, nonprod, or all
Resources shown: S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, IAM roles, EC2 instances
#### **Usage**
.\visualize_aws_tf_env.ps1 -Env all

### `Prerequisites`
* Terraform installed
* AWS CLI installed and profiles set up (dev, nonprod)
* LocalStack running at http://localhost:4566
* PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core

### `üí° Tip`
Use these scripts together for a complete LocalStack + Terraform testing workflow. For example:

.\reset_localstack.ps1
.\apply_env.ps1 -env dev
.\visualize_aws_tf_env.ps1 -Env dev
